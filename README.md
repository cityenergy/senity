## Synopsis

SENITY is an emulator for smart energy deployments targeting city environments. It can emulate sites that contain a smart energy meter, smart energy devices and appliances. Its goal is to become a mininet-like tool promoting research in the respective field, making possible to evaluate algorithms, energy models and complete energy systems (e.g. for demand/response, pricing etc), in various city scenarios.

For more informations regarding architecture, implementation, installation and usage please refer to the https://github.com/pkokkinos/senity/wiki.
