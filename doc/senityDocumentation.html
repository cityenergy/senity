<h2>SENITY: Smart Energy in the City</h2>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
SENITY is an emulator for smart energy deployments targeting city environments. It can emulate sites that contain a smart energy meter, smart energy devices and appliances. Its goal is to become a mininet-like tool promoting research in the respective field, making possible to evaluate algorithms, energy models and complete energy systems (e.g. for demand/response, pricing etc), in various city scenarios.
</p>

<h2>Architecture</h2>
SENITY constis of the following entities:
<ol>
	<li>Site: For the site we follow the "allInOne" approach where all of a site's entities are emulated in single process.
	<li>Emulation Manager: The Emulation Manager is responsible for setting up a particular scenario with a number of sites, devices and energy profiles.
	<li>Communication Bus: All the entities interact through the Communication Bus, exchanging measurements and commands.
	<li>Console: Through Console a user is able to control an emulation scenario, e.g. by turning on and off devices and also get infomration regarding the sites, the devices and their status.
	<li>UI: UI presents various statistics.
</ol>


<h2>Implementation</h2>
<h3>Operational Flow</h3>
The overall operation flow of SENITY is described below:
<ul>
	<li>Site and device configurations in json format are created.
	<li>A scenario is defined in json, utilizing existing site and device configurations.
	<li>The emulator reads the scenario and creates the respective emulated entities (sites, devices).
	<li>The emulator passes through the communication bus the necessary conf info and configures the other software components.
	<li>The sites are initiated and start operating sending consumption data and reacting to commands.
	<li>Events (weather, time of day etc, on/off commands) are send by the emulator through the communication bus and the devices act accordingly.
</ul>

<h3> Configuration files</h3>

SENITY has a configuration file:
<pre style= "white-space: pre-wrap; background: grey; width: 55%">
<font color="white">
	# this is the configuration file for senity

	[General]

	# the folder where device profiles are located
	devices_folder = devices

	# the folder where site descirptions are located
	sites_folder = sites

	# the file holding the log file, if empty logging is disabled
	log_file = senity.log

	# the mqtt broker ip, mqtt port and websocket port
	mqtt_broker_ip = 127.0.0.1
	mqtt_broker_port = 1883
	websocket_broker_port = 9001

	[Console]
	# the waiting time for a console command, which interacts with the mqtt
	console_cmd_waiting = 10

	[Web]

	# enable web ui
	enable_ui = 1

	# web port
	web_port = 8080

	# directory where web files are located
	base_dir = ui
</font>
</pre>

In the current implementation for simplicity reasons we do not have a db instead local jsons hold the necessary information. In particular, the following json files are defined:

<br><br>
In a <b>device json file</b>, the avgConsomption is in watts, while the workingCycle indicates whether the device operates 24/24 or a shorter cycle every time it is invoked e.g. 5/24. InitialStatus indicates whether the device is on(1) or off (0) when the emulations is started or by default. updateInterval is the interval with which measurement are sent by the device, and overide the per site updateInterval. In current version the updateInterval (per device) and workingCycle parameters are not used, instead all the devices update interval is defined throuh the corresponding command sent from the emulation manager for the whole site, while each device working cycle is considered 24/24.

<pre style= "white-space: pre-wrap; background: grey; width: 55%">
<font color="white">
{
  "name" : "aircondition01",
  "type" : "aircondition",
  "status": 1, 
  “updateInterval: 10”
  "avgConsumption": 1100,
  "workingCycle": 5
}
</font>
</pre>

A <b>site json file</b> defines a particular site and the number of devices in it
<pre style= "white-space: pre-wrap; background: grey; width: 55%">
<font color="white">
{ "siteName": "site01",
  "devicesAvailable":
  [
    {"deviceName": "oven01", "deviceCounter": 1},
    {"deviceName": "fridge01", "deviceCounter": 1},
    {"deviceName": "aircondition01", "deviceCounter": 3},
    {"deviceName": "dishwasher01", "deviceCounter": 1}
  ]
}
</font>
</pre>

The <b>scenario json</b> 
<pre style= "white-space: pre-wrap; background: grey; width: 55%">
<font color="white">
{
  "scenarionName": "scen01",
   “updateInterval”: 10,
  "sitesAvailable":
  [
    {"siteName": "site01", "siteCounter": 10 },
    {"siteName": "site02", "siteCounter": 20 }
  ]
}
</font>
</pre>

<h3>Communication messages</h3>
Communication takes places using the communication bus and respective messages are exchanged between the various entities. Third party entites can interact with SENITY through the communication bus in order to receive the status and send commands. Messages exchanged are:
<ol> 
  <li> for configuration purposes
  <li> for scenario setup purposes
  <li> for applying on/off commands
  <li> for advertising the measurements
</ol>

In particular, the following topics are used, while their exact format can change through the constants.py (aka con) file :
<ul>
   <li> Topic: con.TOPIC_SITE_DEVICES_CONF/&lt;site id&gt;, message: An array of the site’s devices’ json files, retain: true, type: emulation related <br> 
This is published from the Emulation Manager and is read by the respective site. We used this way of initially configuring the site entities (instead of giving input parameters) as a more generic approach that can also be used in other modes of operation, except the “all in one” sites. Also, in this way it is also possible to change/update the configuration of a site. This is retained so it is possible for a site to reinitialize after a possible restart, without the Emulation Manager to sent anything, while this message can (and it actually is) be used by UI/CLI/API to get the available sites, devices and their status.
   <li> Topic: con.TOPIC_SITE_CONF/&lt;site id&gt;, message: Update interval, retain: true, type: emulation related <br>
This is published from the Emulation Manager and is read by the respective site. It indicates the interval with which measurement are sent from the site’s devices, assuming a single interval for all devices. Other site related parameters can also be passed this way.
   <li> Topic: con.TOPIC_SITE_DEVICE_STATUS/&lt;site id&gt;/&lt;device id&gt;, message: 0/1, retain: false, type: operation related <br>
This is published from any entity to switch on/off a device. This also leads to updating the site’s devices configuration by the device (not the Emulation Manager as before) sending an updated con.TOPIC_SITE_DEVICES_CONF message
  <li> Topic: con.TOPIC_SITE_DEVICE_CONSUMPTION,  message: energy consumption, retain: false, type: operation related<br>
  This is published from a device, advertising its current energy consumption.
  <li> Topic: con.TOPIC_SITE_CONSUMPTION,  message: energy consumption, retain: false, type: operation related<br>
  This is published from the site, advertising the current energy consumption of all the devices in the site.
</ul>


<h2>Setup and Run</h2>

<h3>Setup</h3>
To setup the environment one needs to 
<ul>
	<li> get the files
	<li> Install and run mosquitto mqtt broker, using the latest source (tested with 1.4.x) and compiling/running with websocket support. This is important, installing mosquitto through apt-get will not work due to incompatibility issues with paho-client and no support for websockets (requried for ui operation's). After installation add the following in the /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf and start it: mosquitto -c /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf -d
	<pre style= "white-space: pre-wrap; background: grey; width: 55%">
	<font color="white">
		listener 9001
		protocol websockets
		listener 1883
		protocol mqtt
	</font></pre>	
 	<li> install necessary python libraries (e.g., paho, prompt_toolkit)
 	<li> in the ui/dashboard.js setup the ip of your machine
</ul>

<h3>Console</h3>

<h3>UI</h3>
One can also use the UI to view the total consumption, the number of sites and devices in the emulation. Turning on/off a device will lead to total power consumption reduction.

<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<ul>
	<li> There is a limitation on the number of sites one can start, depending on the system where SENITY runs. 500 is around the maximum for a normal systems. This is due to the fact that each site is a different process.
	<li> Sometimes after multiple initiations and terminations of SENITY, when you start SENITY a "[Errno 104] Connection reset by peer" msg appears though the normal functionallity still exists. This will be resolved.
	<li> SENITY will not work well with multiple initiations of it, since there is a single communication bus (the mqqt broker).
